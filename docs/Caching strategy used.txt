The caching strategy is fundamental to process so many repos. 

Here's how it works:

Cache Validation is Key: The system can't blindly trust cached data in the intermediatery json files. The lastCommitSHA fields is computed 
on every run and appended to the json entry in the intermediatery files.  This acts as a version identifier for the repository's content. 
If the lastCommitSHA found in the repo (during every run) differs from the one stored in the cache from the previous scan, it means the 
repository has been updated, and the cached data (like laborHours, permissions, readme_content, exemptions, etc.) might be stale.

Connector Responsibility: This initial fetch of the current lastCommitSHA and the comparison against the cached SHA is primarily the 
responsibility of the platform-specific connector modules (e.g., clients/github_connector.py, clients/gitlab_connector.py, etc.).

Workflow:

When scan_and_process_single_target() in generate_codejson.py calls a platform connector (e.g., clients.github_connector.fetch_repositories), 
it passes the previous_scan_output_file path (i.e, the intermediatery file path). The connector uses utils.caching.load_previous_scan_data() to 
load the data from this intermediatery file. This gives it access to the lastCommitSHA recorded during the previous scan for each repository.
For each repository it's about to process in the current scan, the connector makes an API call to the platform (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps) 
to get its current basic metadata, which critically includes the current lastCommitSHA.

Comparison: The connector then compares this newly fetched current lastCommitSHA with the lastCommitSHA from the loaded cache.
If SHAs match (and the repository's empty status, if applicable, is consistent), the repository's content is considered unchanged. 
The connector then reuses the entire detailed entry from the cache (including laborHours, contributors, permissions, readme_content, _codeowners_content, 
etc.) and avoids making further expensive API calls to re-fetch all that detail or re-run analyses like analyze_github_repo_sync().
If SHAs do NOT match (or it's a new repository, or its empty status changed): The repository is considered updated. The connector proceeds 
to fetch all its details fresh from the platform and then calls the necessary analysis functions (like analyze_github_repo_sync from 
utils/labor_hrs_estimator.py and subsequently process_repository_exemptions from utils/exemption_processor.py via generate_codejson.py).

Therefore, the fetch of the current lastCommitSHA is an indispensable part of the process for every repository encountered in a scan target, 
as it's the trigger for deciding whether to use the cache or perform a full data refresh and analysis.
