Scanning many repositories, especially large ones with extensive commit histories, can take a long time. API rate limits, network issues, 
or even just needing to pause the process can interrupt a scan.

The system is designed to scan repositories across different platforms (like GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps). For each repository, it 
gathers metadata and estimates labor hours. A key challenge in such a system is interacting with platform APIs without hitting rate limits, 
especially when dealing with a large number of repositories. To manage this, the system employs sophisticated dynamic delay mechanisms.

Let's break down the main logic and these mechanisms:

Main Logic & API Rate Limit Handling:

The system processes repositories, likely on a per-organization or per-group basis. During this processing, it makes numerous API calls to 
fetch repository details, commit history, and other necessary data. To prevent overwhelming the APIs and encountering rate limit errors, 
two primary, complementary dynamic delay strategies are in place:

----------------------------------
Dynamic Per-API-Call Delay:
----------------------------------
Purpose: 
This mechanism aims to throttle the rate of individual API requests sent while the system is actively working on a single repository. 
It's a fine-grained control.

How it works: 
A delay is introduced either immediately after most API calls or, in specific cases like GitHub's metadata fetching (using ThrottledRequester), 
potentially before. The duration of this delay isn't fixed; it dynamically scales. The base delay is configured 
(e.g., via *_POST_API_CALL_DELAY_SECONDS), and this base is adjusted upwards based on the total number of repositories within the current target 
(e.g., the organization being scanned). This means if you're scanning a small organization, the per-call delay will be shorter than if you're 
scanning a very large one.

Control: Settings like *_POST_API_CALL_DELAY_SECONDS define the baseline, while DYNAMIC_DELAY_* settings control the scaling factor.
Impact: This affects every API call, whether it's fetching repository metadata or paginating through commit history for labor hour estimation.

----------------------------------
Inter-Repository Adaptive Delay:
----------------------------------
Purpose: This mechanism provides a coarser-grained pacing, giving the APIs a more substantial "breather" between the complete processing of one 
repository and the start of the next. This is particularly useful for very large targets.

How it works: 
After all processing for a single repository is finished (metadata fetched, labor hours estimated), this delay kicks in. However, it's 
conditional: it only activates if the total number of repositories in the current target (e.g., organization or group) exceeds a predefined 
threshold (ADAPTIVE_DELAY_THRESHOLD_REPOS).

Control: The ADAPTIVE_DELAY_* settings in the configuration determine if and how long this delay will be.
Implementation: The connector modules for each platform (e.g., github_connector.py) are responsible for reading these settings, calculating the 
appropriate delay, and then pausing execution (using time.sleep()) before moving to the next repository.

----------------------------------
How They Work Together (Optimization in Action):
----------------------------------
Imagine the system is scanning a large GitHub organization:

As it starts processing the first repository, the Dynamic Per-API-Call Delay is active. Every time the PyGithub library (via its ThrottledRequester)
makes a call for metadata, a small, scaled delay occurs. Similarly, when labor_hrs_estimator.py fetches pages of commits, each of those API calls 
is also subject to this fine-grained delay. Once all the data for that first repository is collected and processed, the system checks the total 
number of repositories in the organization. If it's a large organization (exceeding ADAPTIVE_DELAY_THRESHOLD_REPOS), the Inter-Repository Adaptive 
Delay is triggered. The system will then pause for a calculated period before even starting to fetch data for the second repository.

This cycle repeats for all repositories in the organization.

This two-tiered approach is an optimization designed to gracefully handle API interactions, reducing the likelihood of hitting rate limits, 
especially during large-scale scans. The dynamic and adaptive nature of these delays ensures that the system is as efficient as possible while 
remaining a good API citizen.

----------------------------------
General Description of Modules (based on context):
----------------------------------
Connector Modules (e.g., github_connector.py, gitlab_connector.py, azure_devops_connector.py):

General Purpose: These modules are responsible for interacting with the specific APIs of their respective platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps).
Key Functions (inferred): They likely handle authentication, fetching lists of repositories for a given organization/group, and iterating through these repositories to initiate processing for each one.
Rate Limiting Role: As mentioned, they explicitly implement the "Inter-Repository Adaptive Delay" by reading configuration settings and applying a time.sleep() after processing each repository if conditions are met.

labor_hrs_estimator.py:

General Purpose: This module is responsible for estimating the labor hours associated with a repository.
Key Functions (inferred): It likely fetches detailed commit history (authors, dates, possibly changes) for a repository to perform its estimation. 
This involves making API calls, often paginated. Rate Limiting Role: The API calls made by this module are subject to the "Dynamic Per-API-Call Delay" 
to ensure its requests are throttled.

In conclusion, the system employs a sophisticated, layered approach to API rate limit management. This allows it to process potentially vast numbers 
of repositories by dynamically adjusting its request rate at both a fine-grained (per-API-call) and a coarse-grained (inter-repository) level, 
ensuring stability and compliance with API usage policies.
